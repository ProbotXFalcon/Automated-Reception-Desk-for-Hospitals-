# Automated-Reception-Desk-for-Hospitals-
Our project aimed to design an automated hospital reception desk under CS201 Design of Digital Systems. The kiosk system had an easy-to-use interface allowing patients to check in and make appointments. It integrated with the hospital's software and provided real-time updates on doctor availability for a more convenient experience.
